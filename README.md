# Physics Model
PO Modeling

This project is made for school for the PO (practical assignment) Modelling of Physics.
Written in Python.

If the code is a bit cluttered (I think GitHub doesn't like it because the width is limited and my comments sometimes fall off halfway through), the code can be found here as well: https://hastebin.com/iwefujerel.makefile.

I'm not sure how long the link will be valid, usually a month, but if the code is missing, please let me know and I'll update this file with a new link.
 
Fixed values:
- Water depth = 0.3m
- Throw height = 5.0m
- Diameter (sphere) = 0.216m
 
Research shows that the smallest mass under which the sphere still touches the ground is 1,708418 kilograms.
The speed that the sphere still has is 0.0190 m/s, so about 2 centimeters in a second.
